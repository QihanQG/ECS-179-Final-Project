Style: top-down view, and arctic theme. Single level and a single town. Enemies will spawn nearby to attack it. Blocky styles similar to Roblox.

The objective is to protect the town of penguins. Preventing monsters from breaching the wall and killing the King Penguin. If the king penguin dies, the player will have no ability to deploy any more units or command anything else in the game. 

At the start of the game, you are given a tower town to protect. Inside is the king penguin, which is the player, who resides in a small castle at the center with other penguins. Next to the small castle is the research building(engineer penguins), which maintains the wall's self-repairing ability. As long as this building remains intact, the wall-shield and the wall itself will continue to repair itself.

The research building is also responsible for upgrading the turret and gears. They will transfer the blueprint to the nearby factory building, which is primarily responsible for the turrets/gears. The player will have to decide whether it should allocate the research resources to maintain the wall shield or to upgrade the weapons/gears. Less resources/focus on the wall shield means that it will recharge or repair slowly.

The player will also decide what the factory should produce, more turrets, and more shields/gears. How fast the factory can produce these things depends on how many penguins work in there.

The castle will spawn about x amount of penguins in half a minute. You can place the penguins to the research building for faster research or the factory building for faster production.

The main defense unit consists of a variety of turrets, each with special roles. Some are basic gun turrets, others cannon turrets. There are also healer penguins that can restore health and provide buffs. Penguins and turrets can be enhanced with upgrades and gadgets, including shields, specialized bullets, different cannon types, and more. The monsters are numerous but generally slow-moving. Most rely on physical attacks, though some are capable of firing projectiles.

Resources systems:  Passive overtime, After completing each wave, Bonus for good performance( the town take less damage),  Managed by a single mining/production building?
